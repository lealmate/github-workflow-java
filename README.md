# CI/CD with Github Workflow

## Story

This week your goal as a team will be to:
	-Practice your Java skills
	-Get familiar with the GitHub workflow system
	-Testing your code with JUnit

## What are you going to learn?

-Testing with JUnit
-Github workflows
-automation

## Tasks

1. Create a workflow for the github repository
    - After every commit pushed to the repository, the github workflow  automatically builds the project and runs the test, then creates  a report about the test results

2. Test every function in the project
    - Write tests for every method created in the project

## General requirements

None

## Hints

-Explore the system’s behaviour before designing the test cases
-Use your browser in incognito mode when executing the tests
-Don’t forget to ask (the internet, your peers, and then your mentors) in case you have any questions!
